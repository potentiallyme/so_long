# SO_LONG  
## Creating a 2D game  
  
Welcome to my game for the so_long project at 42!  
Solve the mazes, create your own, and donÂ´t get tricked by the unique movement!  
  
This project uses the MinilibX, a simple X-Window programming API in C to render our game, thus it is recommended to use a MAC or LINUX machine to compile the game.  
  
You can create your own map! However, it must fit the following criteria:  
`The map contains ONE player character 'P'`  
`The map is square/rectangular and is closed`  
`The map contains ONE EXIT 'E'`  
`The map contains at LEAST ONE collectible 'C'`  
`The map has to be solvable (player can reach the exit after collecting all the collectibles)`

This map doesn't work (subtle!)  
  
I <em>highly</em> suggest you play my maps first and get a grip on how the game works before creating your own map, it's very specific!  
Tap 'I' in game to get a rundown on how to play :)  
Hope you enjoy!     
  
The sprites are heavily inspired by Tomb of the Mask.
